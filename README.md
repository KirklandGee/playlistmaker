# Basic Playlist Maker

You can access this tool here https://playlistmaker12.surge.sh

Upon opening that link, you'll be prompted to login to your Spotify account before continuing.

This app allows you to query the Spotify API for songs based on a specific search term, add them to a playlist, name that playlist, and add it to your Spotify account.

In the future, I plan to add functionality such as:

- Sampling the songs before adding them to your playlist
- Manipulating existing playlists on your account
- Sharing your created playlist with friends upon creation

This project was created based on a similar project from Codecademy.
